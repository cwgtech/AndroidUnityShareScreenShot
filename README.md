# AndroidUnityShareScreenShot

This extends the base plugin with a ShareScreenShot method, allowing an image and string to be sent to an IntentChooser which is then displayed and interacted with on top of Unity.

This uses a callback reference to directly call a function in C# when the IntentChooser is presented.

It also uses a FileProvider to serve the saved image to the IntentChooser without requiring the external write permission, or those annoying permission popups that are now part of android.
